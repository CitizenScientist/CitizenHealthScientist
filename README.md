## Welcome to the Citizen Scientist Page

This page will report emerging health science knowledge that may be of use to the ordinary citizen. A second goal is to harness the knowledge of each citizen to create holistic knowledge that can be of use to anyone. Across generations or cultures, knowledge can be lost but then reemerge by the telling of one individual's story.

### Topics

Health and healing is the overarching topic, although just as scientific knowledge evolves, the topics on this page will also evolve.
