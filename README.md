# Welcome to the Citizen Health Scientist Page

This page will report emerging health science knowledge that may be of use to the ordinary citizen. Contributions to this page will also help harness the knowledge of individual citizens to create holistic knowledge that can be of use to anyone. Across generations or cultures, knowledge can almost be lost, but can then be regained by the retelling of a story by just **one** person. 

### Topics

The science of health and healing is the overarching topic for the CitizenScientist, although just as scientific knowledge evolves, the topics on this page will also evolve. 

```
Some topics will include:

1. Achieving optimal brain health 
2. Rest and healing
3. Improving cognition through exercise
4. Healthy relationships to improve coping and immune health
5. Minimizing inflammation
6. Reviving folk medicine and the wisdom of past generations
7. Brain health in childhood
8. Brain health and aging

Links to different resources will be curated, so that this site can provide a one-stop shopping.

### Support and Contacts

Because optimal health often requires assistance from a practitioner, helpful links for finding licensed providers will be listed.
